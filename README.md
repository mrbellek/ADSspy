# ADS Spy #

A small tool to list, view or delete Alternate Data Streams (ADS) on Windows 2000/XP with NTFS file systems. 

ADS are a way of storing meta-information about files, without actually storing the information in the file it belongs to, carried over from early MacOS compatibility from Windows NT4. This meta-information is not visible in Windows Explorer.
Recently browser hijackers began using this technique to store hidden information on the system, and even store trojan executable files in ADS streams of random files on the system. 

Use with caution, Windows and several antivirus programs also store (temporary) information in ADS.

*Compatible with: Windows NT4 and newer*
